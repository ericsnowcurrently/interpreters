        If "syncobj" is false then all objects are supported,

        Examples of "shareable" objects include the builtin singletons,

        passed through the queue efficiently.

        The key difference, though, is conceptual: the corresponding

        effectively indistinguishable from each other, even if the

        same object, or a copy (immutable values only), or a proxy.
        Regardless, the received object should be treated as though
        the original has been shared directly, whether or not it
        actually is.  That's a slightly different and stronger promise
